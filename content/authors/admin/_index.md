David Pardo is a Berlin based Data Scientist currently working at Medwing. He is interested in processing and analysing data in order to bring actionable results to different business areas. In order to achieve this he is constantly learning about all the steps in the data journey, from the Data Engineering tasks related to extracting and structuring data to the modeling, visualisation and communication that make the data useful to the final business user. In his free time he enjoys literature, films, philosophy, history, music, photography, generative art, playing football, hiking, diving and traveling as much as he can.
